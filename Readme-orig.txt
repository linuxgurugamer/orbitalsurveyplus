WARNING:
Always backup your saves before upgrading. Most OSP updates are designed with backwards compatibility
in mind, but it can't always be garaunteed. Check the changelog on the forum thread for more information.

OSP OPTIONS AND TWEAKING:
- There is a module manager config file in the [OrbitalSurveyPlus > Patches] folder that contains 
tweakable values for ElectricDrain (drain while scanner is on), ScanRadius (how big the scan area is), 
and SciBonus (multiplier for science gained for scanning and transmitting - vanilla KSP has this at 10). 
Feel free to tweak these values to make things easier or harder.
- There are several options available under the Orbital Survey Plus section of the in-game difficulty menu,
including difficulty tuning and some performance related stuff that might help slower systems.
